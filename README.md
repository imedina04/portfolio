# Portfolio

This GitHub repository hosts the projects I've contributed to, encompassing both digital design and integrated circuit verification. Within the digital design section, you can explore collaborative projects covering aspects of combinational logic, sequential logic, the integration of sensors on FPGA, and the development of a RISC-V Monocycle processor. On the other hand, in the IC verification folder, you'll find projects where I've employed a layered verification model with controlled randomization for a data bus and a router. These repositories serve as a comprehensive showcase of my work in these fields.
